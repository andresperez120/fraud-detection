A machine learning project that detects fraudulent credit card transactions using XGBoost classification. The model achieves a 0.98 AUC-ROC score while handling highly imbalanced data.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes credit card transaction data to identify fraudulent activities. Using advanced machine learning techniques and careful feature engineering, we've built a robust fraud detection system that can effectively distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
